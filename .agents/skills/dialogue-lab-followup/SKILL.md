# Dialogue Lab Follow-up

## Required inputs

- Existing Case ID or enough Post ID + Root Comment ID and branch context to select one candidate.
- Exact new public turn or reaction, supplied URL, observed time, and visible parent context.

## Workflow

1. Treat an explicit Case ID as definitive; otherwise use root-based `case-find` only for candidate discovery and select the Case from branch context, asking when multiple candidates remain materially ambiguous. Load the selected Case once with `case-show`.
2. Parse supplied URLs with `parse-url`, preserve each exact URL, and confirm that the selected Case contains the tracked branch. Never identify a Case from its latest reply.
3. When sibling branches already stored in one Case must be tracked independently, prepare one `case-split-branch` command with an outside-Git backup and exact new title/topic. After explicit approval, run `dialogue-lab check`; if it passes, run the split and use its committed Case/Turn mapping.
4. Assign or reuse only `P1`, `P2`, ... or `USER`. Resolve the direct parent from visible context or user confirmation and retain Parent Confidence; ask only when ambiguity changes the reply.
5. Build one incoming Turn payload. A supplied `reply_comment_id` is its strongest duplicate identity; without one, the transaction uses Case ID + Parent Turn ID (including a null root) + Direction + Exact Text. The transaction returns the existing Turn on a duplicate or allocates a Turn ID, validates the complete parent graph, appends, commits, and reads back.
6. Read repository strategy and evidence Markdown only as needed, verify material claims, and answer the operative claim without treating private planning as public context.
7. Return the standard output. After explicit approval, run `dialogue-lab check`; if it passes, run exactly one `dialogue-lab case-followup --case-id <id> <payload> --approved` transaction and report its compact receipt.

## Output

Return, in order: `Case ID / Status`, optional `Thread Map`, `Claim Map`, `Recommended Reply`, `Shorter Version`, `Why This Approach`, `Fact Check`, `Conversational Potential`, `Log Tags`, and `Next Action`.
