## Instruction enforcement

- All instruction bullets in this file are mandatory, blocking, and
  closure-gating for the phase, action, decision, artifact, or response they
  govern.
- Do not proceed with or claim completion for any action, decision, artifact, or
  response when an applicable instruction bullet is unmet, unverifiable, or in
  conflict; report the blocker or conflict instead.


## HasbaraTops

- Before case work, read the live Operating Manual through the configured Drive ID, verify that its version is supported, and record the revision state used.
- Treat Google Drive as canonical and repository files as non-canonical implementation; never use or commit repository exports as substitutes for live canonical sources.
- Use `config/drive-files.toml`, preserve the live Case Log schema, and check `Post ID + Root Comment ID` for duplicates before allocating a Case ID.
- Invoke the matching Dialogue Lab skill for intake, follow-up, posting confirmation, closeout, or strategy review.
- Never edit, move, rename, replace, delete, import, or summarize `General responses` without the user's explicit instruction for that exact action.
- Before a canonical write, verify that relevant source state has not materially changed; require explicit approval, read the record back, and compare every expected field.
- After a failed required write, follow the Manual's Recovery procedure and block new Case ID allocation while any `PENDING SYNC` is unresolved.
- Never open, inspect, click, scroll, or otherwise interact with Facebook unless the user explicitly asks. Never post to Facebook autonomously. Never store credentials, OAuth material, secrets, or canonical document bodies in Git.

### Repo checkout and worktrees:

- The primary skills repo checkout used to generate installed HasbaraTops skill
  copies must stay either on local `main` tracking `origin/main` or on a local
  `release/*` branch created from `main` for an active unpublished batch.
- Do not develop or patch HasbaraTops skill source directly in the skills repo
  checkout during create, update, audit, or repair work; for any task that
  modifies skills, work in one thread-owned git worktree, name that worktree
  after the thread rather than a subtask, reuse it for follow-on skill changes
  in the same thread unless conflicting branch histories or explicit user
  direction require a new one, and do not place it inside the skills repo
  checkout.
- Keep installed HasbaraTops skill folders generated from the skills repo checkout
  path, not from task worktrees. For local preview of unpublished batches,
  refresh remote refs with `git fetch --prune origin`, then merge ready worktree
  branches into the skills repo checkout's local `release/*` branch and rerun
  `skills/ceratops-skill-lifecycle/scripts/runtime/install-managed-skills.ps1`
  instead of generating installed skills from task worktrees.
- Do not stage skill-source changes into a local `release/*` batch unless the
  task explicitly requests staging, shipping, or local preview sync.
- Skills-repo changes must ship from `release/*`, never directly from task or
  feature branches.
- New HasbaraTops skill creation is the only default-staging exception:
  `$ceratops-skill-lifecycle` create must finish with change-promotion and
  install verification unless the user opts out.
- For staging or shipping, use `$ceratops-skill-lifecycle` change-promotion or
  ship-to-remote. After shipping, restore the checkout from `origin/main`,
  reinstall managed skills from `main`, and report retained worktrees or release
  branches.

### Instruction and skill maintenance:

- Before proposing or editing `AGENTS.md`, `automation.toml`, `SKILL.md`, shared
  skill sections, skill manifests, or helper-contract text, re-open the relevant
  files from disk and use the current contents as the source of truth.
- Treat recommendations about instruction, automation, skill, and
  helper-contract changes as advisory unless the user explicitly asks to apply a
  named change.
- In repo-tracked files intended for public sharing or GitHub, including
  repo-tracked `AGENTS.md`, `automation.toml`, `SKILL.md`, generated runtime
  skill files, scripts, docs, and examples, do not hardcode user-local absolute
  filesystem paths unless an external runtime explicitly requires them; use
  repo-relative paths or portable variables such as `$CODEX_HOME`.
- For skill runtime workflows, invoke shared helpers through installed console
  commands, `python -m <module>` entrypoints, or scripts copied into the
  installed skill folder; do not locate shared helpers by absolute paths or by
  the repo's parent directory.
- When a workflow needs a shared repo-maintenance script, run `scripts/<name>`
  from the active source checkout root when available, otherwise from the
  installed skill folder; when a helper is skill-local, run it from that skill
  folder or the corresponding source skill folder; stop as blocked if neither
  declared location contains it.
- Prefer concise, principle-based, machine-oriented wording; avoid example lists
  unless the examples are needed to disambiguate behavior.
- After instruction edits, verify the changed diff or reopened section and
  confirm no new duplicate, contradiction, or dropped behavior was introduced.
- When an automation uses a script or helper, compare prompt and code before
  finishing and keep outcome, blocker, cleanup, alert, and memory paths aligned.
- Put deterministic, testable, or procedural automation behavior in scripts or
  helpers rather than prompt text when such helpers exist.
- When updating an automation, skill, instruction, or related helper script,
  assess whether the change could materially increase recurring or avoidable
  credit usage; if so, report that before treating the update as done.
